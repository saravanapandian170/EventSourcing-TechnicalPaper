# Tiny Habits Assignment

## 1. BJ Fogg’s Flossing Story
BJ Fogg shares a simple story about how he built the habit of flossing by starting with a tiny action—flossing just **one tooth** each day. Because it was so small, he never skipped it, and over time this tiny habit naturally grew into flossing all his teeth. The story shows his main idea: **big change starts with something so small you can’t fail.**

## 2. B = MAP
B = MAP means that a behaviour (B) happens only when **Motivation (M)**, **Ability (A)**, and a **Prompt (P)** come together at the same moment.  

To make new habits easier, don’t rely on motivation because it goes up and down. Instead, increase **Ability** by making the habit tiny and easy, and add a clear **Prompt** by attaching the habit to something you already do.

- **M = Motivation:** your desire to do the behaviour  
- **A = Ability:** how easy the behaviour is  
- **P = Prompt:** the reminder or cue that tells you to do it  

By boosting **A** (make it tiny) and fixing **P** (attach it to a routine), the habit becomes easy enough to do even when motivation is low.

## 3. Importance of “Shine” / Celebration
- Celebrating creates a **positive emotion**, and emotion is what makes the brain remember and repeat a behaviour.  
- “Shine” gives you an immediate **reward**, so your brain marks the habit as something good and worth doing again.  
- It builds **confidence**, making you feel capable and successful, even with tiny actions.  
- Celebration helps the habit feel **easy and enjoyable**, instead of feeling like a chore.  
- The positive feeling reinforces the habit pathway in the brain, so the behaviour becomes **automatic** much faster.

## 4. British Cycling Story
- The most interesting idea is the story of **British Cycling’s transformation**, where tiny 1% improvements in hundreds of small areas led to massive success.  
- It powerfully shows how **small, almost invisible changes** can compound into extraordinary outcomes over time.  
- The concept that **habits are the compound interest of self-improvement** stands out because it reframes progress as something that grows automatically once small actions are repeated.  
- The **two-minute rule** is compelling because it makes starting so easy that failure becomes unlikely.  
- The idea that habits shape your **identity**—that every small action is a vote for the person you want to become—is one of the most inspiring takeaways.

## 5. Identity and Habits
- The book emphasizes that **true behavior change comes from identity change**, not just achieving goals.  
- Every small habit is a **vote for the type of person you want to become**.  
- By consistently performing actions aligned with your desired identity, you **reinforce that identity** over time.  
- Instead of focusing only on outcomes, the book advises **shaping your self-image** so that habits naturally follow who you believe you are.  
- Identity-based habits make change **sustainable**, because actions come from who you are, not just what you want to achieve.

## 6. Making Habits Easy
- The book emphasizes **making habits easy** to reduce friction and increase the likelihood of performing them consistently.  
- Break habits into **smaller, manageable steps**, like the **Two-Minute Rule**, where any new habit should take two minutes or less to start.  
- **Environment design** is key: remove obstacles for good habits and make the desired behaviour more accessible.  
- Automate or simplify the habit so it **requires less motivation and effort**, making it almost effortless to begin.  
- The easier a habit is to do, the more likely it will **stick and compound** over time into a lasting behaviour.

## 7. Making Bad Habits Harder
- The book advises making **bad habits harder to do** by increasing friction or adding obstacles.  
- **Remove triggers or cues** from your environment that prompt the unwanted behaviour.  
- Introduce **steps or delays** that make performing the bad habit inconvenient or time-consuming.  
- Make the habit **less attractive** by highlighting negative consequences or pairing it with an unpleasant action.  
- By making bad habits more difficult, they are less likely to be repeated, helping you **break them over time**.

## 8. Habit I Want to Do More: Reading Books
**Steps to Make It Stick:**  
- **Cue (Make it Obvious):** Keep the book on your desk or bedside table and set a fixed reading time each day.  
- **Make it Attractive:** Pair reading with a cup of tea or choose books that genuinely interest you.  
- **Make it Easy:** Start with just 5–10 minutes a day and keep books accessible in multiple formats.  
- **Make it Satisfying:** Track your progress, celebrate finishing chapters, and reflect on what you read.  

This approach uses clear cues, enjoyment, simplicity, and positive reinforcement to make reading a consistent habit.

## 9. Habit I Want to Reduce: Checking Social Media
**Steps to Reduce or Eliminate It:**  
- **Make the Cue Invisible:** Remove social media apps from your phone home screen or log out after each use.  
- **Make the Process Harder:** Set app time limits, use website blockers, or require extra steps to access social media.  
- **Make it Unattractive:** Remind yourself of lost time or negative effects of excessive scrolling.  
- **Make the Response Unsatisfying:** Track wasted time and reflect on missed opportunities whenever you give in to the habit.  

This approach reduces triggers, increases friction, and adds negative feedback to make the habit less likely to occur.
